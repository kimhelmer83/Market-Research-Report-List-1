<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Discs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Type</li><li>Disc Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake discs market primarily consists of two main types: drum type and disc type. Drum brakes utilize a cylindrical drum that houses brake shoes that press against the inner surface to create friction, often found in rear brakes for light vehicles. Disc brakes, on the other hand, feature a flat disc that is squeezed by brake pads, providing superior heat dissipation and performance, commonly used in modern vehicles for both front and rear brakes, enhancing overall safety and efficiency.</p></p>
